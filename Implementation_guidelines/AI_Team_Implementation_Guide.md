# Complete AI Team Implementation Guide

*Master documentation for AI assistants to understand and implement the DigiNativa AI Team system from start to finish*

---

## üìã **OVERVIEW: WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING**

You are helping implement a **fully autonomous AI development team** that builds the DigiNativa learning game. This team consists of 6 specialized AI agents that work together to develop features from GitHub issue to deployed code.

### **System Architecture Overview**

```
GitHub Issue (Feature Request)
        ‚Üì
   Project Manager (analyzes & breaks down)
        ‚Üì
   Game Designer (creates UX specification)
        ‚Üì
   Developer (implements React + FastAPI code)
        ‚Üì
   Test Engineer (creates automated tests)
        ‚Üì
   QA Tester (validates user experience)
        ‚Üì
   Quality Reviewer (final approval)
        ‚Üì
   Deployed Feature (in production)
```

### **Dual Repository Strategy**

- **AI-Team Repository:** Contains agent implementations, contracts, and coordination (this repo)
- **Product Repository:** Contains game code, feature branches, and production deployment (separate repo)

---

## üß¨ **PROJECT DNA: THE FOUNDATION**

Before implementing ANY code, you must understand the Project DNA. This is the **shared decision-making framework** that ensures all agents work cohesively.

### **DNA Documents Location: `docs/dna/`**

1. **`design_principles.md`** - The 5 core principles guiding all decisions
2. **`architecture.md`** - Technical constraints and patterns
3. **`target_audience.md`** - User personas and context
4. **`game_design_document.md`** - Complete product vision
5. **`component_library.md`** - UI/UX standards (Shadcn/UI + Kenney.UI)

### **How DNA Functions as Team Coordinator**

**Critical Understanding:** DNA isn't just documentation - it's an **automated decision framework** that prevents agent drift.

```python
# Every agent decision must validate against DNA
def make_agent_decision(options: List[Any]) -> Any:
    # 1. Filter by design principles
    valid_options = [opt for opt in options if validates_all_5_principles(opt)]
    
    # 2. Apply architecture constraints  
    compliant_options = [opt for opt in valid_options if follows_architecture(opt)]
    
    # 3. Choose simplest solution (KISS principle)
    return choose_simplest_solution(compliant_options)
```

**DNA Prevents Team Fragmentation:**
- Without DNA: Each agent makes assumptions ‚Üí fragmented product
- With DNA: All agents use same criteria ‚Üí cohesive product

---

## üîó **AGENT CONTRACT SYSTEM: THE CRITICAL FOUNDATION**

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:** Every agent interaction MUST use strict, machine-readable contracts. This enables modular development where each agent can be improved independently.

### **Standard Contract Format**

```json
{
  "contract_version": "1.0",
  "story_id": "STORY-{feature_id}-{increment}",
  "source_agent": "{agent_role}",
  "target_agent": "{agent_role}",
  "dna_compliance": {
    "design_principles_validation": {
      "pedagogical_value": boolean,
      "policy_to_practice": boolean,
      "time_respect": boolean,
      "holistic_thinking": boolean,
      "professional_tone": boolean
    },
    "architecture_compliance": {
      "api_first": boolean,
      "stateless_backend": boolean,
      "separation_of_concerns": boolean,
      "simplicity_first": boolean
    }
  },
  "input_requirements": {
    "required_files": [string],
    "required_data": object,
    "required_validations": [string]
  },
  "output_specifications": {
    "deliverable_files": [string],
    "deliverable_data": object,
    "validation_criteria": [string]
  },
  "quality_gates": [string],
  "handoff_criteria": [string]
}
```

### **Why Contracts Are Critical**

**Problem without contracts:**
```python
# ‚ùå This creates tight coupling - can't develop agents independently
spec = await game_designer.create_spec(story)
code = await developer.implement(spec)  # Direct dependency!
```

**Solution with contracts:**
```python
# ‚úÖ Loose coupling via standardized contracts
contract = StandardContract.from_story(story)
await event_bus.delegate_to_agent("game_designer", contract)
completed_work = await event_bus.wait_for_completion(story_id)
```

### **Technology Stack**

**Frontend:**
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/UI component library
- Kenney.UI game assets

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python)
- SQLite (MVP) ‚Üí PostgreSQL (Production)
- Stateless design (no server-side sessions)

**Deployment:**
- Netlify for frontend hosting
- Netlify Functions for backend
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### **Architecture Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **API-First:** All communication via REST APIs, no direct database calls from frontend
2. **Stateless Backend:** All state passed from client, no server-side sessions
3. **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend and backend remain completely separate
4. **Simplicity First:** Choose simplest solution that works, optimize only when needed

---

## üîÑ **WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Feature Development Lifecycle**

1. **GitHub Issue Created** by project owner using feature request template
2. **Project Manager analyzes** issue against DNA principles and creates story breakdown
3. **Stories delegated** to appropriate agents via standardized contracts
4. **Each agent processes** their assigned work according to contract specifications
5. **Quality gates enforced** automatically at each handoff
6. **Feature branch created** in product repository with implemented code
7. **Project owner approval** required before merge to main branch

### **Dual Repository Workflow**

**AI-Team Repository (Development):**
- Agent code and configurations
- Contract definitions and validation
- Team coordination workflows
- DNA documentation

**Product Repository (Delivery):**
- Feature branch creation by agents
- Game implementation code
- Production deployment pipeline
- Project owner approval workflow

### **Branch Management**

**Naming Convention:**
```
feature/STORY-{story_id}-{short-description}
Example: feature/STORY-001-user-registration
```

**Approval Process:**
1. Agent creates feature branch in product repo
2. Agent implements code according to contract
3. All quality gates pass automatically
4. Agent creates PR for project owner review
5. Project owner tests in preview environment
6. Project owner approves/rejects via GitHub interface
7. Approved features merged to main branch

       def process_contract(self, input_contract):
           # Validate input contract
           # Process work according to contract

---

## üö® **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES**

### **Contract Enforcement**

```python
# NEVER allow handoff without contract validation
if not contract.validate_before_handoff():
    raise ContractViolationError("Cannot proceed - contract validation failed")

# ALWAYS validate DNA compliance
if not dna_validator.validate_decision(agent_output):
    raise DNAComplianceError("Output violates project DNA principles")
```

### **Architecture Compliance**

```python
# ALWAYS follow API-first principle
# ‚ùå NEVER do this:
user = database.get_user(user_id)  # Direct database call from frontend

# ‚úÖ ALWAYS do this:
user = await api.get_user(user_id)  # API call with all state passed
```

### **Quality Gates**

```python
# NEVER skip quality gates
def handoff_to_next_agent(work_output):
    if not all_quality_gates_pass(work_output):
        return rollback_and_retry()
    
    return delegate_to_next_agent(work_output)
```

## üéØ **NEXT ACTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANT**

When helping implement this system, you should:

1. **First:** Understand the Project DNA completely by reading `docs/dna/` files
2. **Second:** Implement contract validation framework before any agents
3. **Third:** Create one agent at a time, testing contracts at each step
4. **Fourth:** Validate end-to-end workflow with mock data
5. **Fifth:** Help test with real feature implementation

**Always ask:** "Does this implementation follow the contract specifications and DNA principles?"

**Never proceed** without validating contracts work correctly.

**Remember:** The goal is modular agents that work together cohesively through strict contracts and shared DNA principles.
