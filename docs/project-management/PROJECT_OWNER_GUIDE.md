# Project Owner's Guide to Managing Your AI Development Team (Priority Queue System)

*A comprehensive guide for project owners who want to understand how to direct and communicate with the DigiNativa AI-Team*

## 🎯 Overview: How to Direct Your AI Team

As a project owner, you work with a fully autonomous AI team that can develop features from idea to finished implementation. The team follows a **Priority Queue** - a smart priority system that automatically selects the next feature based on your prioritizations.

### Your Responsibility as Project Owner

**Feature Prioritization**: Decide which features are most important via GitHub Issues  
**Dependency Management**: Specify if features depend on each other  
**Quality Approval**: Review and approve/reject completed features  
**Course Corrections**: Change priority or provide feedback at any time

### AI Team's Responsibility

**Intelligent Prioritization**: Automatically selects next feature based on priority + dependencies  
**Technical Implementation**: Build everything from UX design to code and tests  
**Quality Assurance**: Follow all technical standards and design principles  
**Continuous Reporting**: Keep you updated on progress and problems

## 📋 Phase 1: Create and Prioritize Features

### How to Create a Feature Request

#### 1. Go to GitHub Issues

- Open your project's GitHub repository
- Click "New Issue" → "Feature Request"
- Fill in the structured template

#### 2. Describe Your Feature Clearly

```markdown
Title: Add user registration

As [Anna, public sector employee]
I want [to be able to create an account]  
so that [my learning progress is saved between sessions]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Users can register account with email
- [ ] Password is validated securely
- [ ] Progress is saved automatically
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
```

#### 3. Set Priority (IMPORTANT!)

Select priority level in template:

**P0 - Critical**: Must be done immediately, blocks other work  
**P1 - High**: Important features for current focus  
**P2 - Medium**: Improvements that can wait  
**P3 - Low**: Future wishlist items

#### 4. Specify Dependencies (if relevant)

If this feature requires other features to be completed first:

```markdown
Dependencies: #123, #124
```

or

```markdown
Depends on: User authentication (#123) to be completed first
```

### What Happens Next?

The AI team's Priority Queue works like this:

```
GitHub Issues Repository = AI Team's Priority Queue

[P0] Critical security fix (#125) ← Next to do
[P1] User registration (#123) ← Dependencies clear  
[P1] Progress reporting (#124) ← Waiting for #123
[P2] Mobile optimization (#126) ← Can be done anytime
[P3] Advanced analytics (#127) ← Future feature
```

The AI team automatically selects:

✅ Highest priority first (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)  
✅ Only features where all dependencies are complete  
✅ Skips features that are already being analyzed

## 🎛️ Flexible Priority Queue Management

### Change Priority Anytime

#### Raise Priority:
```powershell
# In GitHub Issue, change label from:
priority-p2  →  priority-p1

# AI team sees change and adjusts automatically
```

#### Add Urgent Feature:
- Create GitHub Issue with "priority-p0"
- AI team pauses current work (if lower priority)
- Starts on critical feature immediately

#### Change Dependencies:
```markdown
# Update Issue body from:
Dependencies: #123

# To:
Dependencies: #123, #124
# (Now waits for both before starting)
```

### Live Priority Queue Status

You can always see current queue via GitHub Issues:

```markdown
🎯 Current Priority Queue Status:

🔄 IN PROGRESS:
- #123: User registration (P1) - 80% complete, delivery tomorrow

⏳ READY TO START:
- #124: Progress reporting (P1) - Waiting for #123
- #126: Mobile optimization (P2) - No dependencies  

🚫 WAITING FOR DEPENDENCIES:
- #125: Advanced analytics (P1) - Requires #123 + #124

📋 FUTURE:
- #127: External system integration (P3)
- #128: Reporting functions (P2)
```

### Smart Dependency Management

The AI team understands dependencies automatically:

```markdown
# These formulations all work:
Dependencies: #123, #124
Depends on: #123  
Requires #123 to be completed first
Must complete #123 and #124 before starting
Blocked by: #123
```

## 🚨 When Something Goes Wrong

### AI Team Handles Most Issues Themselves

**Automatic problem solving:**

✅ Technical errors → debugging and rework  
✅ Quality issues → automatic correction  
✅ Dependencies blocking → waits until resolved  
✅ Minor design problems → internal coordination

### When You Need to Be Involved

Escalation to you only occurs for:

⚠️ Deadline risks affecting critical features  
⚠️ Technical decisions requiring strategic input  
⚠️ Dependencies that seem to have wrong priority  
⚠️ Quality problems the AI team cannot solve

### Escalation Example:

```markdown
🚨 Escalation needed - Mobile Optimization (#126)

Problem: Performance requirements (>90) cannot be met with current approach
Impact: 
- 3 days delay on #126
- May affect start of #127 which depends on this

AI team's suggestions:
1. Compromise performance (85 score) for faster delivery  
2. Rework architecture (+3 days, guarantees 95 score)
3. Split feature: basic function now, optimization later

Priority Queue impact:
- #127 can start anyway (no dependency)  
- #128 can be reprioritized to compensate

Your input needed: Which approach do you prefer?
Decision deadline: Tomorrow 12:00 PM
```

## 💡 Tips for Effective Priority Queue Management

### Do This ✅

#### Set Clear Priorities
**P0**: Security issues, system crashes, blocking errors  
**P1**: Core functions users are waiting for  
**P2**: Improvements that make experience better  
**P3**: Nice-to-have for the future

#### Use Dependencies Smartly
```markdown
# Clear dependencies:
Dependencies: #123 (user auth), #124 (data model)

# Avoid vague dependencies:  
Dependencies: "when we've fixed the auth system"
```

#### Change Priority Proactively
- Raise priority when deadline approaches
- Lower priority if something is no longer urgent
- Add P0 for acute problems

#### Approve Features Quickly
- Test within 24-48 hours when notified
- Give specific feedback instead of "it doesn't feel right"
- Approve quickly to keep AI team in flow

### Avoid This ❌

#### Don't Confuse the Priority System
❌ **Wrong**: All features have P1 (high priority)  
✅ **Right**: Spread out P0/P1/P2/P3 based on real importance

#### Don't Constantly Change Requirements
❌ **Wrong**: Change acceptance criteria while feature is developing  
✅ **Right**: Let ongoing feature complete, create new Issue for changes

#### Don't Create Circular Dependencies
❌ **Wrong**: #123 depends on #124, #124 depends on #123  
✅ **Right**: Split features so dependencies go one direction

#### Don't Micromanage the AI Team
❌ **Wrong**: "Why aren't you starting on #127 instead?"  
✅ **Right**: Change priority on #127 so AI team selects it automatically

### Optimal Work Pace

#### Priority Queue Flow:
**2-3 P1 features per week**: Stable delivery pace  
**1 P0 feature per month**: Manageable for acute problems  
**5-10 P2/P3 in backlog**: Provides planning flexibility

#### Approval Cycle:
**24-48h feedback**: Keep AI team in flow  
**Test for real**: Use preview as Anna would  
**Specific feedback**: "Change X to Y" instead of "it doesn't work"
