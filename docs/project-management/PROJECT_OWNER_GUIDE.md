# Project Owner's Guide to Managing Your AI Development Team

*A comprehensive guide for project owners who want to understand how to direct and communicate with the DigiNativa AI-Team*

## 🎯 Overview: How to Direct Your AI Team

As a project owner, you work with a fully autonomous AI team that can develop features from idea to finished implementation. The team follows your directives but works independently between your decision points.

### Your Responsibility as Project Owner

**Strategic Planning**: Decide which features to build and in what order  
**Quality Approval**: Review and approve/reject completed features  
**Course Corrections**: Provide feedback when the team needs to change direction

### AI Team's Responsibility

**Technical Implementation**: Build everything from UX design to code and tests  
**Quality Assurance**: Follow all technical standards and design principles  
**Continuous Reporting**: Keep you updated on progress and problems

## 📋 Phase 1: Plan Your Project (Roadmap)

### How to Create Your Plan

#### 1. Define Your Features in roadmap.md
Create a file called `docs/dna/roadmap.md` where you list all features you want:

```markdown
# My Project Plan

## Current Sprint (ongoing work)
- [ ] Feature 1: User authentication (Priority: High)
- [ ] Feature 2: Basic game mechanics (Priority: High)

## Next Sprint (planned)  
- [ ] Feature 3: Progress reporting (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Feature 4: Mobile optimization (Priority: Medium)

## Future features (wishlist)
- [ ] Feature 5: Advanced analytics (Priority: Low)
```

#### 2. Set Priorities

**High Priority**: Must be done first, blocks other work  
**Medium Priority**: Important features that can wait  
**Low Priority**: Nice-to-have for the future

#### 3. Describe Dependencies
If certain features must be done before others, write it clearly:

```markdown
- Feature 3 requires Feature 1 (authentication) to be completed first
- Feature 4 can be done in parallel with other features
```

#### What Happens Next?

✅ AI team automatically reads your roadmap  
✅ Project Manager selects next feature based on priority and dependencies  
✅ You get notification when team starts working on each feature

---

## 🎪 Phase 2: Communicate Feature Requests (GitHub Issues)

### How to Order Features

#### 1. Create a GitHub Issue

- Go to your project's GitHub repository
- Click "New Issue" → "Feature Request"
- Fill in the structured template

#### 2. Describe Your Feature Clearly
Use this structure:

```markdown
Title: Add user registration

As [Anna, public sector employee]
I want [to be able to create an account]  
so that [my learning progress is saved between sessions]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Users can register account with email
- [ ] Password is validated securely
- [ ] Progress is saved automatically
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
```

#### 3. Set Priority and Timeline

- Select priority level in template
- Indicate if urgent or can wait
- Describe any deadlines

### What Happens Next?

Within 24 hours you get a response from the AI team that looks like this:

```markdown
🤖 AI-Team Analysis Complete

✅ RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED
💭 Reasoning: Feature aligns with project goals and 
   is technically feasible

📊 Planning:

```

### How to Follow the Work

**GitHub Issues**: Check specific features and their progress  
**Live Previews**: Test features while they're being developed  
**Automatic Notifications**: Get updates in your email/Slack  
**Weekly Reports**: Summary of what has happened

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Approve or Reject Completed Features

### When a Feature is Complete
You get a notification that looks like this:

```markdown
🎉 Feature ready for approval: User Registration (#123)

✅ All quality checks passed
✅ Tested from end-user perspective  
✅ Follows all design principles

```

### Your Options

#### 🟢 Approve Feature

- Click "Approve" in GitHub Issue
- Feature is automatically deployed to production
- AI team continues with next priority

#### 🟡 Request Minor Changes

- Comment on what needs to be adjusted
- AI team makes changes and returns
- You get to test again when it's ready

#### 🔴 Reject Feature

- Explain what is wrong or missing
- AI team analyzes feedback and suggests new approach
- Major rework is done according to your directives

### Example Feedback

```markdown
I tested the registration function:

✅ Good: Easy to use, fast registration
✅ Good: Works perfectly on mobile  
⚠️  Issue: Password requirements are unclear to user
❌ Problem: Registration form is too long

Request changes:
1. Add clear text about password requirements
2. Simplify form - just email and password is enough
3. Add "Show password" button

Priority: Medium (not critical but should be fixed)
```

## 🚨 When Something Goes Wrong

### Automatic Problem Handling
The AI team handles most problems themselves:

**Technical errors**: Debugging and rework  
**Quality issues**: Automatic correction  
**Minor design problems**: Internal coordination

### When You Need to Be Involved
You are contacted only when:

- Problems significantly affect delivery times
- Technical decisions require your strategic input
- Budget or resources risk being exceeded
- Quality problems that the AI team cannot solve themselves

### Escalation looks like this:

```markdown
🚨 Escalation needed - Mobile Optimization (#124)

Problem: Performance requirements cannot be met with current approach
Impact: 3 days delay, may affect next sprint
AI team's suggestions: 
1. Compromise performance for faster delivery
2. Rework architecture (3 extra days)
3. Split into smaller parts and deliver incrementally

Your input needed: Which approach do you prefer?
Decision deadline: Tomorrow 12:00 PM
```
